1. Setup and Understanding
Sign up for a personal account at GitHub.com. Understand that Git is the local version control software that tracks file changes, while GitHub is the cloud-based platform used to store, share, and collaborate on those files.

2. Create a Repository
Click "New repository" on GitHub to create a project "folder" (e.g., hello-world). Ensure you include a README file, which uses Markdown to provide an overview and instructions for your project.

3. Manage the Workflow
Work on a branch to make safe edits without affecting the main code. Use commits to save your progress, then push your changes to the remote repository or pull updates from collaborators to keep everything synced.
